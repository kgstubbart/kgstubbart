## Hello there, I'm Kason 👨🏽‍💻

I’m a Computer Science: Software Engineering student at BYU passionate about making technology approachable and using it to solve real-world challenges. As a research assistant, I’ve worked on projects from modeling swarm behaviors to analyzing networks of power and poverty. I love building intuitive user experiences and enjoy working with Python, Java, and exploring UI design. In 2024, I presented my research at the BYU Student Research Conference to a professional audience. I’m excited about creating technology that empowers people and being part of communities that inspire growth and collaboration.
